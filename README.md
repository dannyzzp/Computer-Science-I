# Computer-Science-I
These are all the homework assignments from Computer Science I at the University of Scranton (not including work from CS I Lab)
This is a entry-level course for first-year Computing and Engineering-related major students. I already took this course in my sophomore year back in Fu Jen Catholic University, but I'm retaking it here to both solidate my programming skills and computer science knowledge, and get used to the studying style here in the US.
